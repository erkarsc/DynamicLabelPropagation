# DynamicLabelPropagation
Dynamic label propagation ML algorithm implemented in Rust.
Functions are contained within src/main.rs.
The code is currently set up to run tests from samples of the USPS digit image dataset and test accuracy of the algorithm.
Algorithm as described in the following paper:
Wang, Bo and Tu, Zhuowen and Tsotsos, John."Dynamic Label Propagation for Semi-supervised Multi-class Multi-label Classification." Proceedings of the ICCV, 2013.


**NEXT STEPS** test algorithm on wine dataset, enable blas, alter inputs of main function, allow  for user defined number of labels
